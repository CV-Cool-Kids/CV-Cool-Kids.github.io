<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>States across the country are working to reopen their facilities and public health authorities are assisting in facilitating this transition for most. During this transition, there have been a number of problematic and concerning statistics recorded from sources such as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/23/most-americans-say-they-regularly-wore-a-mask-in-stores-in-the-past-month-fewer-see-others-doing-it/ft_2020-06-23_masks_01/">Pew Research Center</a> which claims fewer than two-thirds of U.S. adults claiming to wear masks are actually following suit. This is a concerning statistic for local businesses and supermarkets whose employees' livelihoods are in jeopardy based on customer compliance to simple mask wearing rules. In order to assist with the transition for stores, we pose the challenge of utilizing computer vision to create a system that can detect people wearing face masks in real time. This sort of system would be ideal for security usage in physical shops and stores at an assortment of locations. For effectiveness, we would constrain our system to be capable of detecting any number of faces at distances of up to 20ft away from any real-time camera feed. Given this live camera feed, this system should produce a percentage certainty that someone in the camera is wearing their mask. This system should also give an option to alert users of the system as to whether someone has entered without wearing a mask.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>We hope to use a variety of computer vision algorithms in order to create a system which can both crop faces out of a larger image and classify whether a mask is imposed over the image or not. We plan on using a Haar Classifier to crop faces out of the larger image. This will provide us with smaller images of the isolated faces, rather than a larger image which might contain multiple faces and background elements. As a baseline, we intend to train a CNN on similar facial images in order to classify across whether a mask is present on the face and whether it is placed correctly or not. Additionally, we will experiment with the use of data preprocessing algorithms like blob detection and background separation on the inputs to the CNN to see if we can increase accuracy. If necessary, we will also attempt to transform/augment our data in order to make our algorithm effective for different mask colors and types.</p>


<br><br>
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
<p>Dataset:</p>
<p>We will use the datasets from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08016">this paper</a> which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net">this GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Code: We intend to make use of modules like OpenCV and Keras in building our project. We may use some helpful methods in OpenCV to expedite certain steps in our project such as the Haar Cascade classification to isolate faces and face features. Obviously, to set up our CNN, we’ll use Keras methods/classes as needed.</p>
<p>We believe success would be having a statistically significant result (>95%) in positively detecting whether or not a person was wearing a mask and if they were wearing it correctly. Furthermore, we believe that by using various preprocessing algorithms, we’ll be able to identify which algorithms work the best in yielding meaningful results.</p>
<p>We expect the results to be pretty straightforward: either the classifier works well or it doesn’t. Uncertainty might arise from our implementations of the preprocessing and what parameters we use for Haar and in our CNN. Furthermore, it's possible that the proportion of not-wearing a mask at all to wearing-incorrectly in the “Incorrect Face Masking Dataset” could skew how well we are able to identify the difference between (wearing, incorrect) vs (not-wearing, ___). Also since all the masks in the dataset are the same color, we might attempt to algorithmically change the color of some of the masks in the training dataset so the classifier works on all types of masks.
